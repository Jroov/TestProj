[MidRight]Sir, are you okay?[ANL]
We're almost there, I can[NL]
see the entrance to the town.[A]
[MidLeft]Yes, son, I'll be alright.[ANL]
These old bones can hold out[NL]
a while longer...[ANL]
At least until the relic is safe.[A]
[MidRight]If your wound is draining[NL]
your energy, I can carry you.[A]
[MidLeft]I'm fine, son.[NL]
Let's just get to the skyship.[NL]
Then we can tend to our wounds.[ANL]
I only wish we were able to[NL]
bring a few more men with us...[A]
[MidRight]...[AN]
They gave up their lives[NL]
for you to escape, as would I.[ANL]
We must carry on, for their[NL]
sakes.[A]
[MidLeft]You're right. Koff...[ANL]
Let's go.[A]
[MidRight]Hold on, I can hear[NL]
something...[ANL]
This village may not be safe,[NL]
I'll scout on ahead.[A]
[MidRight][ClearFace]
[MidLeft]...[A]
[MidRight][LoadBriscoe]
[MidRight]It's as I feared.[ANL]
The village is lost, though[NL]
the ship is still in port.[ANL]
There are a few villagers holding[NL]
their ground, but they won't last long.[ANL]
[MidLeft]Let's work with them to[NL]
take back the ship. Koff...[ANL]
Even if the relic is our treasure,[NL]
I am still only human...[ANL]
The least I can do is try to[NL]
save a couple of my countrymen.[ANL]
And if we fail even then... we would[NL]
not have succeeded, regardless.[ANL]
[MidRight]I'll go and talk to them,[NL]
sir.[ANL]
Stay back and out of danger,[NL]
and I'll come get you if it's safe.[A][X]

Guys, get ready to fight![A]
[FarLeft]Calm yourself, I'm[NL]

Can you all fight?[A]
[Right]...[ANL]
Yes.[A]
[Left]We've been able to fend[NL]
off a few enemy troops so far,[ANL]
but we don't know how much[NL]
longer we can hold out.[A]
H-
[Right]How much help is there?[A]
[FarLeft]It's just me and the[NL]
king's advisor.[ANL]
He's badly injured, but[NL]
can still walk and cast spells.[ANL]
The rest... didn't make it.[ANL]
The capitol is lost.[ANL]
If you can still keep up,[ANL]
we can fight for the skyship[NL]
in port and escape.[ANL]
If not, you can stay here to die.[A]
[Right]...[ANL]
We'll fight.[A][X]

[MidLeft]Ah, Medrick. I'm glad to[NL]
see you unharmed.[A]
[MidRight]Same to you, granny.[ANL]
Make sure not to open your door[NL]

[MidLeft]Ah, I've seen my fair share[NL]

If I bite the dust here, it won't be[NL]

a proper person.[A]

This stab wound is telling me[NL]

[MidLeft]I admire your honesty.[NL]
Here, take this.[ANL]
It won't be of much use to you,[ANL]
but I suspect you won't last[NL]
much longer anyways.[ANL]
That's quite a nasty wound.[ANL]

I'm okay, though I think the[NL]
rest are having a tough time.[A]
[MidLeft]I'd imagine, with all[NL]
those soldiers out there.[ANL]
Take this, it should help[NL]
you relieve a bit of their burden.[A]
[MidRight]Oh, thank you! But...[NL]
Are you going to be okay?[ANL]
I don't want to leave you behind...[A]

If you can pick up a spear,[NL]
come and fight with us.[A]
[MidLeft]Us? There are more[NL]

Then why do you need me?[ANL]
The village is safe now,[NL]
right?[A]
[MidRight]I'm afraid not.[ANL]
I'm fighting alongside a few[NL]
of your fellow villagers.[ANL]
We're going to make it through[NL]
to the skyship,[ANL]
but an extra spear would help.[ANL]
Fighting out there is better[NL]
than being a sitting duck in here.[ANL]
We can protect you out[NL]

[MidLeft]Well... uh...[ANL]
I was going to wait here[NL]

[MidRight]They'd kill you in[NL]
seconds.[ANL]
I admire your courage,[NL]

Come with me and we can[NL]
escape on the skyship.[A]
[MidLeft]The skyship..? But[NL]
