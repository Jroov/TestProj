[FarRight]Wow... I never thought I'd get[NL]
to see the world from up here.[ANL]
[Right]It's a good reward for the work we[NL]
put in fighting those soldiers.[AN]
[Left]...Where do we go now?[NL]
Our home...[AN]
[Right]Rasmus said we're headed for[NL]
ally country,[AN]
we can settle down there.[A]
[FarRight]But there's still war going on,[NL]
how do we know we'll be safe?[A]
[FarLeft][LoadRaza]Apologies for interrupting,[AN]
but we're going to be passing[NL]
through a cloud.[AN]
It's not safe out here, you all[NL]
should come inside.[A]
[FarRight]Alright, let's go.[A]
[FarRight][ClearFace]
[Left][ClearFace]
[FarLeft]And you?[A]
[Right]Right, sorry...[AN]
Just wanted to admire the skies[NL]
for a little while longer.[A]

[MidRight]Ah, Rasmus.[NL]
Oh! He's asleep...[AN]
What's this on his nightstand?[NL]
Some sort of amulet?[AN]
[FarFarLeft][LoadMiruna]
[FarFarLeft]Rustle...[A]
[MidRight][MoveRight]
[MidRight]What was that?[AN]
The rest are probably wondering[NL]
where I am, anyways.[A]
[MidLeft][LoadMiruna]
[MidRight]Oh! Hello there.[A]

[MidLeft]What're you doing?[AN]
We're at war here,[NL]
act like it.[A]
[MR]Raza's my boss, not you.[A]
And besides, who said being[NL]
serious was a necessity in a fight?[AN]
[ML]Ugh.[AN]
Just get to your post.[A]
[MR]Alright, I'm goin'.[A]
[MR][ClearFace]
[MR][Raza]
[MR]You shouldn't treat him like that.[A]
[ML]You should know better.[AN]
This isn't a situation where we[NL]
can joke around.[A]
[MR]I know more than you ever[NL]
will about war, son.[AN]
I know what I'm saying.[NL]
You could use a break yourself.[A]
[ML]Wait... do you see that?[NL]
Behind you.[A]
[MR]No, this isn't good...[AN]
That cloud is closer than[NL]
I thought...[AN]
Warn the rest! We have to[NL]
be on high guard.[AN]
[ML]Can we maneuver around it?[A]
[MR]They're coming after the relic,[NL]
some clouds won't stop them,[AN]
but it'll give us some cover.[AN]
If we went around, we'd be open[NL]
from all sides.[AN]
In there, we're at least[NL]
a little covered.[A]

[FarLeft]What're you still doing[NL]
here?![AN]
I gave you an order![A]
[FarRight]I'm not a soldier. I've been[NL]
through enough already.[AN]
Why do I have to keep fighting?[AN]
[FarLeft]Unbelievable. Your friends[NL]
listened right away.[AN]
Fine, you want to die here?[NL]
Be my guest.[AN]
Grumble and moan all you want,[AN]
but out there, we're fighting for[NL]
you and you're fighting for us.[AN]
It'll be on you if your cowardice[NL]
sinks this ship.[A]

Is my memory failing me[NL]
like my body is?[AN]
No, no, it was here![AN]

It means a lot that there's someone[NL]
around I can rely on.[A]

Don't worry yourself.[AN]
